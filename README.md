## About the Project

GenPlay Studio! is a cutting-edge, web-based tool designed to make game creation accessible to everyone, regardless of their coding background. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, our platform allows users to select from a variety of classic game templates, then personalize them with unique AI-generated visuals and fine-tune gameplay parameters, all culminating in a fully playable, exportable HTML5 (H5) game. Our mission is to transform complex game development into a simple, intuitive, and fun experience for non-technical users.

### Built With
Frontend: React.js, HTML5 Canvas, Tailwind CSS  
Backend/AI Integration: Node.js (Express.js, path, fs, fs/promises, cors, archiver), Hugging Face API (for text generation and image generation, potentially Tone.js for sound generation)  
Deployment: Locally Hosted

## Features

GenPlay Studio! offers a robust set of features designed for simplicity and power:

### Intuitive User Workflow:

The user experience begins with a welcoming screen, followed by a selection interface for five classic game templates.

Users can choose any of the available templates: Flappy Bird, Speed Runner, Whack-the-Mole, Simple Match-3, and Crossy Road.

The workflow is streamlined: Pick Template â†’ Reskin (AI) â†’ Set Parameters â†’ Export.

### Five Classic Game Templates:

Start creating instantly with pre-built templates for:

- Flappy Bird  
- Speed Runner  
- Whack-the-Mole  
- Simple Match-3  
- Crossy Road

### AI Reskinning:

Generate new characters, backgrounds, obstacles, and other artistic assets using simple text prompts. The platform utilizes the Hugging Face text-to-image model (stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0) for on-the-fly generation and also provides a library of pre-generated AI assets for quick selection.  
(For this demonstration, the primary visual customization leverages these pre-generated AI assets to ensure optimal speed and reliability due to API credit considerations.) Customize:

- Environment/Background  
- NPCs & Main Character

### AI-Driven Game Parameter Controls:

Modify game mechanics through natural language or smart AI suggestions.

For Flappy Bird: Adjust gravity, pipe gap, and game speed via a dedicated left panel. Change character, pipes, and background image using AI prompts or pre-generated AI assets.

For Speed Runner: Modify player horizontal speed and obstacle spawn delay. Change the main character and obstacles using AI prompts.

### Dynamic Difficulty Settings:

AI adjusts game parameters based on "Easy," "Medium," or "Hard" selections.

### Rapid Customization:

Experience quick AI reskinning, aiming for under 1 minute per instance.

### One-Click H5 Export:

Download your customized game as a zipped folder containing an index.html file, ready to play offline.

## Key Strengths & Criteria Alignment

Our project is built with the judging criteria firmly in mind:

- **Technical Execution**: Demonstrates smooth AI integration for both visual and parameter generation, resulting in robust and playable H5 games.  
- **Usability**: Prioritizes a user-friendly interface and a clear, step-by-step workflow, ensuring true accessibility for non-technical users.  
- **Export Quality**: Guarantees fully functional H5 games that accurately reflect all user customizations and run seamlessly offline.  
- **AI/LLM Usage**: Leverages AI effectively for generating unique art assets (via Hugging Face text-to-image model and pre-generated assets), influencing gameplay mechanics.  
- **Speed**: Optimizes the reskinning process to be highly efficient, targeting under 1 minute per instance.  
- **Bonus Features**: We have explored and potentially implemented features beyond the core requirements to enhance the user experience and showcase advanced AI capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for frontend and backend)  
- npm or yarn  
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darshna21-bit/gamegen-project.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd gamegen-project
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
# For a typical Node.js/Express app, this might be:
# If your package.json for backend is in a 'backend' subdirectory:
# cd backend
# npm install 
# cd ..
# If your backend package.json is in the root alongside frontend:
npm install # or yarn install (if all dependencies are in one package.json)
```

Configure API Keys (Optional for Demo):

While GenPlay Studio! is designed to leverage the Hugging Face API for real-time asset generation, you can still run the demo using the included pre-generated AI assets without an API key.

If you wish to enable real-time AI generation, you will need to obtain an API token from Hugging Face.

Create a `.env` file in your backend directory and add your Hugging Face API token:

```env
HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Usage

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will typically start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will typically start the backend on http://localhost:5000.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Follow the intuitive 4-step workflow:

1. Pick a game template.  
2. Use AI prompts to reskin its visuals.  
3. Adjust gameplay parameters with AI assistance.  
4. Click "Export" to download your customized H5 game!

## Future Enhancements

We are actively exploring or have implemented the following beyond the core requirements:

- **AI-Generated Background Music (BGM)**: Allowing users to create or select unique background music for their games, powered by AI.  
- **AI-Driven Logic Extension**: Capabilities for users to prompt for minor gameplay logic modifications (e.g., "Make moles shake before they appear") and have the game's code adapt.  
- **Mobile Game Controls**: Incorporating touch and sensor-based controls into the exported H5 games for optimal mobile experience.

## What's Open for Exploration

We believe there's immense potential for further innovation:

- Adding more diverse game templates.  
- Introducing more advanced AI-driven personalization options.  
- Developing novel user interaction paradigms for game design.  
- Exploring unique export formats or direct publishing options.
