## 🧩 About the Project

**GenPlay Studio!** is a cutting-edge, web-based tool designed to make game creation accessible to everyone, regardless of their coding background.  

Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, our platform allows users to select from a variety of classic game templates, then personalize them with unique AI-generated visuals and fine-tune gameplay parameters through a single, high-level prompt.  

All creations culminate in a fully playable, exportable HTML5 (H5) game.  
> Our mission is to transform complex game development into a simple, intuitive, and fun experience for non-technical users.

### 🔧 Built With
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5 Canvas, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend / AI Integration:** Node.js (Express.js, path, fs, fs/promises, cors, archiver)  
- **AI Models via [SegMind](https://www.segmind.com):**  
  - SegMind Vega – text-to-image generation  
  - bg-removal-v2 – background removal  
  - Claude 3 Haiku – gameplay & visual logic adaptation
